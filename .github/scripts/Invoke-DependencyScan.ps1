<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Records the known vulnerabilities in the dependencies the package ships.

.DESCRIPTION
    Advisory by design. A finding is annotated and attached to the release as evidence but never holds
    up the publish; the blocking gate for newly introduced vulnerable dependencies is the
    dependency-review job on pull requests, which stops them entering master. A scan that fails to run,
    however, is an error: silence must not be mistaken for a clean result.
